#General Assembly Project 2: Get Prep'd
##Overview 
I made a app called Get Prep'd. This app helps users like me get ready for job interviews. Many young people including myself are not always interview prepared. This includes what to wear, how to answer certain questions, and looking at demos. This app will not just help future developers,but all job fields.
